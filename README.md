How do I approach designing software?

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? 
The new skills I gain from this course is just percision from each project and how projects were made and such. Also, learning how to troubleshoot in a way that I have gotten better helped me along the way.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I usually followed the announcements that my teacher provided and some youtube vidoes that helped me along the way for some parts odf each project in this course.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I feel like it'll help me troubleshoot in some cases I won't be fond with this type of work, but I would definitely use the troubleshooting part for scripting or other coding methods.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I made new strides with learning how to mess with vertices color, shading, lighting, and texturing. Even though i didn't use this for my 3D scene I have used it for many other projects I have completed alongside it. Overall, with learning this 3D project I learned some new things even though I didn't finish. I struggled with most of it, but I managed to pull through something.

How did iteration factor into your development?
It became a bit of a repeatition in some areas, but overall I enjoyed it to a point of time feeling accomplished about finishing my working or learning new methods. Sometimes It would be frustrating and annoying to even do sometimes.
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach with developing the project wasn't completed, but I made very good proghress than I would have before. Seeing how my progress is better than to not try it. Overall, learning about the code and developing and e volving within this course helped me learn more about what this course has to offer.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I feel like I can learn how to troubleshoot a lot betetr than before, and just enjoy playing around with such coding properties and learning those type of coding properties. Even though i struggled with a ton of it, but I manage to pull off and learned no ways on this course. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Sadly, this isn't my fond specific part of coding I would like to do, but the troubleshooting aspects helped me along the way I will use this to my advantage when working on coding and different types of coding.


Module Eight Software Test Automation
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure? 
Because I etsted it out many times before and those tests came out positive. I worked throughout the tests and fixed upon things within each java file in the zipfile I sent.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understand the requirements within the code and asking questions with code related and whatnot. Prioiritizing features within the eclipse program, and having prtotypes before the main files. 

How do I approach designing software?
I apporach it with problem solving techinques and learning what the code is and how does it function.
